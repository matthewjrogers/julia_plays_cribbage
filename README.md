# julia_plays_cribbage
One of my favorite games is the card game cribbage. Because I am both a game enthusiast and a data junkie, I wanted to learn if a cribbage hand could be optimized for pegging. To that end, I wrote a monte carlo simulation of the game and recorded the results. 

The code is rough (I wrote it quickly, with a specific question in mind) but certainly fast enough for the problem it solved!
