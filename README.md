# julia_plays_cribbage
One of my favorite games is the card game cribbage. Because I am both a game enthusiast and a data junkie, I wanted to learn if a cribbage hand could be optimized for pegging. To that end, I wrote a monte carlo simulation of the game and recorded the results. 

The code is rough. I wrote it quickly, with a specific question in mind. Further, I wasn't sure at the outset that Julia would be fast enough to get the number of games I wanted. Once I had finished, I did not feel it was worth the effort to optimize the code for a silly little game simulator. However, even then the code was fast enough for the problem it solved!
